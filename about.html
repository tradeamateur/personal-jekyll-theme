## About

Hi I'm an amateur trader, an has been since 2013 - FYI Im still not in break even, so this is not about me showing of my greate trades telling the world how good I am.
I created this block to talk about, how it is to be an amateur on the financial market, and to talk about the phycologies that you as a trader feel

In my professional life i work as a process optimizaion guy in a IT company.
