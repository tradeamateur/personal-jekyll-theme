    - ratio to Intrinsic value 
    - Etc.
- Dividend record
    - Must have uninterupted payments for at least 10 years
- Stabile earnings
    - In the last 10 year I exspect no more than 2 time max 5% decline in the year-end earnings
- Growth in Earnings
    - ten year growth of at least 30% in EPS
- earnings Yield
    - Earnings Yield. An earnings yield of at least 6.7%, i.e., a maximum of 15 times price to earnings of the past three years, or at least as high as the current AA bond yield.
    
    
- Dividend yield - defining a dividend stock
There are many definitions of a dividend stock some should it be 2/3 of the AAA bond yield or a minimum of 4%, my take on this is that if you whant to invest the most definition of your perfect company is stabile, and your not getting that by setting relative standards.
So i you pick the more "Hard coded" value i.e. 4% then in times with high interest rate, there will be alot of companies succeeding on this single parameter, which is greate because in times like that you will whant to ride the wave.
but due to the fact the this is the last parameter, all the unhealthy companies should already have been filtered out.
so here my value is 4%, but not over 75% of ther earnings.
